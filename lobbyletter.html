        <p> Dear Representative, </p>
        <p> I am a California constituent in the San Francisco area. Recently, I have become very concerned
        about legislative impact on Coronavirus. As a parent yourself, I am sure that you share many of
        these concerns. </p>
        <p> As a California resident, I am concerned about the possible spread of the coronavirus across our
        borders.  We write to ask how your agency is prepared to address the threat presented by the
        coronavirus at U.S. borders.  </p>
        <label for="lname">I ask that you support </label>
        <input type="text" id="lname" name="lname">
        <p> All citizens should have the opportunity to be healthy now and in the future. I believe that in
        supporting this bill you will impact the lives of countless children and elderly.
        I respectfully seek answers to these questions about coronavirus safety. It is imperative that your
        agency members are protected and that local officials in border states are informed. I would be
        grateful for any update that you can provide. </p>
        <p> Sincerely, </p>
